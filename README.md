My implementation of the Calculator project for The Odin Project. Try it [here](https://jooo-lee.github.io/calculator/)!

## Description:

The user is able to calculate simple arithmetic operations involving adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing.

## I learned how to:

* Design for mobile first
* Use grid-column-start / grid-column-end to place grid items 
* Allow buttons to be clicked using the keyboard 
* Push to array and pop from array
* Slice array elements
* Use indexOf() to check if given element is present in string
* Replace characters in string using replace()
* Parse numerical value from string using Number()
* Truncate string using toFixed()
